# iBill 
## Summary
iBill is an application that allows users to log items sold to customers and simply create a printable invoice.
## Usage
- Create, Update, Delete, Retrieve items in a Sortable and Searchable table
- Create a simple HTML, read-only, printable invoice 
## UI/UX 
The user gets started by clicking the Register link for an account, once they are logged in  and then sign in to the dashboard. In this application, one user account can create and store their own lists of items. Each billing database is unique to the user's account. 
The landing page provides basic information and instruction of usage for the iBill application.

The user can sign in with exsiting account or register then sign in.
            
I want to give the user simplicity and ease of access while using this application, so I kept the UI clean and simple.
